# LiquiFact Frontend

Web app for **LiquiFact** — the global invoice liquidity network on Stellar. Next.js dashboard for SMEs (upload invoices, get liquidity) and investors (fund tokenized invoices, earn yield). Stellar wallet integration is planned.

Part of the LiquiFact stack: **frontend** (this repo) | **backend** (Express API) | **contracts** (Soroban).

## UI Components

See [COMPONENTS.md](COMPONENTS.md) for the full component library reference — props, accessibility notes, and usage examples for every shared component (`ErrorBanner`, `Footer`, `InvoiceListSkeleton`, `ToastProvider`, `UploadZone`, `WalletStatus`).

## Invoices Page

The SME invoices page (`app/invoices/page.js`) pairs `UploadZone` with the new `InvoiceList` component to deliver instant feedback on uploaded invoice documents.

- `InvoiceList` supports an injectable `loadInvoices` prop, making it easy to test without a backend.
- The component renders a skeleton loader while invoices are fetched and announces completion through a polite `aria-live` status region.
- If there are no invoices, the page displays the localized fallback copy from `copy.invoices.emptyState`.
- When `UploadZone` successfully uploads a file, it calls `onUploadSuccess` so the invoice list can update optimistically.
- The list shows explicit lifecycle badges for: `Pending tokenization`, `Tokenized`, `Funded`, and `Settled`.

---

## Design Tokens

Global tokens are defined in `app/globals.css` and used across all components.

| Token             | Value     | Tailwind equivalent |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| `--color-bg`      | `#0f0f0f` | `slate-950`        |
| `--color-primary` | `#06b6d4` | `cyan-400`         |

Font: **Geist** is loaded via `next/font/google` (see `app/layout.js`). Headings use `font-bold`; body copy uses the default weight.

---

## Testing

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for the full guide covering Jest unit/accessibility tests and Playwright end‑to‑end setup.

### Notes about newly added tests

- `app/page.test.tsx` — Unit tests covering the Home page API health check interaction (success, network error, and loading/disabled button states). These tests mock `global.fetch` and use `@testing-library/user-event` for interaction. They are intended to improve coverage for the home page health-check flow.

## API Integration

[docs/api-integration.md](docs/api-integration.md)

---

## Development

| Command            | Description                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`      | Start dev server (Turbopack) |
| `npm run build`    | Production build             |
| `npm run start`    | Start production server      |
| `npm run lint`     | Run ESLint                   |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Run Playwright smoke tests (toast & invest marketplace) |

Default: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The home page can check API health at `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (default `http://localhost:3001`).

The invoices page header also uses the shared `NavMenu` component, replacing the old bespoke header so navigation and wallet entry stay consistent across routes.

### Marketplace search

The Invest page (`app/invest/page.js`) includes an issuer search field above the invoice list. Typing in the field filters invoices by case-insensitive substring match on `issuer`. Input is debounced at **200ms** to avoid thrashing on every keystroke. When a filter is active, the `aria-live` status region announces the match count (e.g. "2 of 3 invoices match"). A distinct "no matches" state is shown when the filter yields zero results, separate from the empty-marketplace state.

## Accessibility

### Skip-to-content link

A visually-hidden "Skip to content" link is the first focusable element on every page. It becomes visible when focused (first Tab press) and jumps the keyboard user past the navigation header directly to `<main id="main-content">`.

All interactive elements (nav links, card links, buttons) use a consistent `focus-visible` cyan outline that matches the brand's primary colour. The utility classes are defined in `app/globals.css`:

- `.skip-link` — positions and reveals the skip link on focus
- `.focus-ring` — reusable `focus-visible` outline for custom interactive elements

---

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions runs on every push and pull request to `main`:

- **Lockfile check** — asserts `package-lock.json` is in sync with `package.json`
- **Lint** — `npm run lint`
- **Build** — `npm run build`

Keep all checks passing before opening a PR.

To reproduce the lockfile check locally:

```bash
npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts
git diff --exit-code package-lock.json  # exits 1 if drifted
```

---

## Dependency updates

Dependabot opens weekly PRs on Monday to keep npm packages and GitHub Actions current.

PRs are grouped to limit noise:
- **nextjs-react** — `next`, `react`, `react-dom`, and their `@types` packages together (coordinated bumps).
- **dev-tooling** — all remaining `devDependencies` in one PR.
- **github-actions** — action version bumps in a separate PR.

**Reviewing a Dependabot PR**

1. Check the CI run passes (lockfile check + lint + build).
2. Scan the changelog/release notes linked in the PR description for breaking changes.
3. For `nextjs-react` bumps, do a quick smoke test (`npm run dev`) locally.
4. Approve and merge — **do not enable auto-merge**; every dependency bump requires a human reviewer.

## UI Components

See [COMPONENTS.md](COMPONENTS.md) for the full component library reference — props, accessibility notes, and usage examples for every shared component (`ErrorBanner`, `Footer`, `InvoiceListSkeleton`, `ToastProvider`, `UploadZone`, `WalletProvider`, `WalletStatus`).
## Invoice List

The invoices page now renders an SME invoice table below `UploadZone` using `InvoiceList`.

- `InvoiceList` accepts an injectable `loadInvoices` prop so data loading can be mocked during tests and swapped for a backend API later.
- While invoices are loading, it renders `InvoiceListSkeleton` and exposes a polite `aria-live` status region for assistive technology.
- If no invoices are returned, it shows `copy.invoices.emptyState` text.
- If invoice loading fails, an accessible `ErrorBanner` is displayed with localized fallback copy.
- After `UploadZone` successfully uploads a document, `onUploadSuccess` appends a new optimistic invoice entry immediately without requiring a manual browser refresh.
### Wallet connection (`WalletProvider`)

Wallet state is shared app-wide via `WalletProvider`, mounted in `app/layout.js` inside `ToastProvider`. Any client component can read connection state with `useWallet()`:

```jsx
import { useWallet } from '@/components/WalletProvider';

function FundInvoiceButton() {
  const { state, walletData, connect, disconnect } = useWallet();

  if (state !== 'connected') {
    return <button type="button" onClick={() => connect()}>Connect wallet</button>;
  }

  return <span>Ready to fund as {walletData.address}</span>;
}
```

**Persistence:** On successful connect, a minimal snapshot is saved to `localStorage` under `liquifact-wallet-snapshot`:

| Field | Persisted | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| `version` | Yes | Schema version (`1`) |
| `state` | Yes | Only `connected` is restored |
| `address` | Yes | Truncated display form only (e.g. `GABC...XYZ123`) |
| `network` | Yes | `public` or `testnet` |
| `balance` | **No** | Fetched live after real wallet integration |
| Private keys / secrets | **Never** | Rejected on read if detected |

The provider rehydrates from storage **after mount** (SSR-safe). `disconnect()` clears storage immediately. See [WALLET_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md](WALLET_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md) for the full integration contract.

### NavMenu

`components/NavMenu.jsx` — Responsive site-wide header navigation used on every page.

**Props**

| Prop            | Type       | Default            | Description                                      |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `walletLabel`   | `string`   | `'Connect Wallet'` | Label text rendered inside the wallet button     |
| `onWalletClick` | `function` | `undefined`        | Callback fired when the wallet button is clicked |

**Behaviour**

- **Desktop (≥ `md` breakpoint):** Home, Invoices, and Invest links render inline in the header row alongside the wallet button.
- **Mobile (< `md` breakpoint):** Nav links are hidden behind a hamburger toggle (☰). Clicking the toggle reveals a dropdown menu below the header bar.
- The active route is detected automatically via `usePathname` and marked with `aria-current="page"` on the matching link.
- The menu closes on **Escape** (with focus returned to the toggle button), on any navigation event (pathname change), or when the toggle is clicked again.
- Passes `jest-axe` accessibility checks in both open and closed states. The toggle exposes `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` so assistive technologies can correctly announce the disclosure state.

**Usage**

```jsx
import NavMenu from "@/components/NavMenu";

// Drop-in replacement for the static <header> on any page
export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-slate-950 text-slate-100">
      <NavMenu />
      <main>...</main>
    </div>
  );
}

// With Stellar wallet integration
<NavMenu walletLabel="Freighter" onWalletClick={handleConnectWallet} />;
```

## Design Tokens

- **Colors**
  - `--color-bg`: `#0f0f0f` (slate‑950)
  - `--color-primary`: `#06b6d4` (cyan‑400)

- **Typography**
  - Font family: **Geist** – imported via `@fontsource/geist`.
  - Headings use `font‑bold`, body uses `font‑regular`.

## Testing

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for the full guide covering Jest unit/accessibility tests and Playwright end-to-end setup.

## Backend Health Check

The home page health check now:

- Uses an 8 second timeout.
- Aborts hung requests.
- Safely handles HTML and malformed JSON responses.
- Reports one of the following:

  - Connected
  - Degraded
  - Unreachable

- Provides a detailed disclosure for raw responses.

## Contracts

- [WALLET_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md](WALLET_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md)
- [FILTER_CONTRACTS.md](FILTER_CONTRACTS.md)

---

## Security

- **Bounded health rendering** — The home page displays the backend `/health` response
  through a bounded pipeline: recognised fields (`status`, `message`, `version`) are
  extracted and shown in a structured summary. The full payload is hidden behind a
  collapsible `<details>` element and stringified via a depth-limited (max 5 levels),
  length-truncated (max 2000 characters) formatter (`lib/format/safeJson.js`).
  This prevents DoS from giant or deeply nested attacker-controlled payloads.

### Code-splitting: WalletStatus

`WalletStatus` is lazy-loaded via `next/dynamic` (`ssr: false`) so the wallet
chunk (including the upcoming Stellar/Freighter SDK) is **not** shipped in the
initial JS bundle for routes that do not need immediate wallet access
(e.g. the static home page).

| Route | Before (kB) | After (kB) | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` (home) | ~X kb | ~X kb | –Y kb |
| `/invoices` | ~X kb | ~X kb | –Y kb |
| `/invest` | ~X kb | ~X kb | –Y kb |

*Run `npm run build` and inspect `.next/static/chunks` to verify. The wallet
chunk appears as a separate file and is only fetched when the header mounts
`WalletStatusLazy`.*

**Why `ssr: false`?** The wallet SDK accesses `window` during init; server
rendering would crash and bloat the SSR bundle. A static placeholder with
matching outer dimensions (`h-12 w-80`) prevents layout shift while the chunk
downloads.

**Placeholder → component swap** is handled by `next/dynamic` automatically.
The placeholder is `aria-hidden` so screen readers only interact with the
live region inside the real `WalletStatus` once it mounts.
