# Security Notes

## XSS Prevention

### ESLint Rule: `react/no-danger`

The project enforces the `react/no-danger` ESLint rule at the **error** level. Any use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` will cause the build to fail.

### Audit (2026-06-27)

A full codebase audit found **one** occurrence of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in production source code:

| File | Line | Usage | Verdict |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| `app/layout.js` | 55 | Inline theme script (`THEME_SCRIPT` constant) — runs before React hydration to prevent flash of incorrect theme | Safe — static constant, not user-supplied data |

All other content is rendered via:
- Static JSX expressions (`{content}`)
- `JSON.stringify()` inside `<pre>` blocks (safe)
- Text content through React's built-in escaping

### Exception Allowlist

| File | Reason | Approved |
|------|--------|----------|
| `app/layout.js:55` | Pre-hydration theme script — content is a compile-time constant (`THEME_SCRIPT`), no user input involved. Required for flash-free theme toggle. | ✅ |

### CI Enforcement

The lint step in CI runs `npm run lint`, which includes the `react/no-danger` rule. Any new introduction of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` will be caught and block the pipeline.

### Dependencies

- **eslint-plugin-react** (bundled via `eslint-config-next`) — provides the `react/no-danger` rule.
- The rule is configured in `eslint.config.mjs`.
